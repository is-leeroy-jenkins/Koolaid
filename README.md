	Web crawlers, also known as spiders, are most often used by search engines such as Google, Bing DuckDuckGo, 
	to go through web pages and read the content on them. Web crawlers work by giving them an initial address to 
	start from and from there it will find new addresses to browse through. Web crawlers benefit a lot from concurrency,
	since usually the highest amount of time is spent loading the page. By using some concurrent method such as using multiple 
	threads to load and read through the pages, performance of the crawler can be substantially increased..
